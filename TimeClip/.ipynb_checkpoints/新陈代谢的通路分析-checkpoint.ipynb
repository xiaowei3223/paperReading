    "在这篇文章中，作者描述了几种类型的人类乳腺肿瘤的转录组学和代谢组学特征，以揭示代谢物的特征使用非靶向的发现方法。他们发现2-羟基戊二酸单共代谢产物(2HG)在一个肿瘤亚群中大量积累，并发现2HG水平的增加与乳腺癌MYC通路激活之间存在关联。作为混合代谢物和基因拓扑分析的一个例子，我们将使用代谢物丰度和基因表达的数据集，如补充文件中所述，只选择肿瘤样本，并比较ER+和ER-乳腺癌。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们将使用KEGG和SMPDB数据库中的通路信息来识别一组特征，这些特征的活动在两个示例类之间发生了显著变化。这一结果有望提示一些特定的生物学活动，是病理改变肿瘤样本。"
